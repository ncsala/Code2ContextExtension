## [0.2.2] - 2025-05-14

### ✏️ Changed in 0.2.2

- **Major Internal Refactoring for Stricter Hexagonal Architecture**:
  - Core application services (`FileLoaderService`, `OutputComposer`, `TreeService`, and underlying tree generation logic) have been significantly refactored to strictly adhere to hexagonal architecture principles.
  - Key services are now fully decoupled from direct Node.js `fs` module dependencies, interacting with the file system exclusively through the `FileSystemPort`.
  - The `FileSystemPort` interface was enhanced (e.g., `listDirectoryEntries`, richer `stat` method) and `FsAdapter` updated to implement these changes.
  - Dependency injection mechanisms within `CompactProject` and `TreeGeneratorFactory` were refined to ensure correct propagation of `FileSystemPort`.
  - This refactoring significantly improves the internal design, modularity, testability, and long-term maintainability of the extension's core.
- **Unit Test Suite Overhaul**:
  - All unit tests for the refactored services (`TreeService`, `FileLoaderService`, `OutputComposer`, `CompactProject`) have been thoroughly updated and corrected.
  - Tests now accurately reflect new method signatures, dependencies, and correctly mock the `FileSystemPort` and other abstracted services, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a "green" test suite.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-05-10

### ✨ Added

- **New "Full Stack Wizard" AI Prompt Template**: Added a comprehensive prompt (`fullStackWizard`) designed for in-depth code analysis, architectural reviews, security audits, and performance evaluations.
- **Improved Webview Initialization**: The "Root Directory" field in the webview now automatically populates with the current VS Code workspace path upon opening, streamlining the initial setup.
- **Automatic File Selection Clearing**: When generating context in "files" mode, the list of selected files in the extension's file explorer (and reflected in the webview) is now automatically cleared after the generation process is initiated.
- **Enhanced Panel and Sidebar Interaction**:
  - The main generator panel and the sidebar (containing File Selection & Options) now open more cohesively.
  - Clicking "Select Files" in the webview now attempts to correctly focus the "File Selection" view in the sidebar.
  - Opening the extension's sidebar view (e.g., from the Activity Bar) will now automatically open the main generator panel if it's not already visible, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### ✏️ Changed in 0.2.1

- **Webview Refactoring**: Significantly refactored the main webview component (`App.tsx`) by extracting stateful logic and message handling into custom React hooks (`useExtensionMessages` and `useDebugOutputManager`), improving code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
- **Message Standardization**: All user-facing notification messages within the extension have been standardized to English and are managed via centralized constants.
- **Console Logging**: Improved the console log interception mechanism to use the `console.subscribe` API (with a fallback for older VS Code versions), preventing interference with other extensions and improving stability.
- **Packaging & Assets**:
  - Refined `.vscodeignore` rules for a leaner and more optimized VSIX package.
  - Drastically reduced the file size of `icon.png` to minimize the overall extension bundle size.
- **Dependencies**: Updated all project dependencies (root and webview) to their latest stable versions.
- **Internal Code Quality**: Various internal refactorings, including removal of unnecessary comments and improved TypeScript typings for better code clarity.

### 🐞 Fixed in 0.2.1

- **Webview Root Path Stability**: Implemented more robust logic in the webview to ensure the `rootPath` (current workspace directory) is reliably initialized and maintained, preventing it from being unintentionally cleared by subsequent state updates.
- (The console logging change also implicitly fixes potential issues related to patching the global console).

## [0.1.4] - 2025-05-07

### 🐞 Fixed in 0.1.4
